Print mesh information.

Print number of vertices, number of polygons, min/max angles, min/max edge lengths
bounding box, etc.

Can report whether mesh violates manifold conditions and whether mesh self intersects.

Can report information on individual mesh vertices and/or polygons, on all polygons
containing a vertex or edge, and on polygons with angles less than or greater
than some value.

Can also produce a histogram file of mesh characterstics such as angle frequencies
and edge lengths.
