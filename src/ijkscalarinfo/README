Report information about a regular scalar grid.

Report grid axes, number of grid vertices, edges, cubes, min/max scalar values,
number of vertices with scalar value 0, etc.

Also report local max of scalar frequencies, isosurface area, etc, as a function
of the isovalue.

Can be used to create histogram (table) of scalar frequencies, isosurface area, interval
volume volume, gradients, etc. as a function of the isovalue.
(Histograms can be plotted using gnuplot.)
