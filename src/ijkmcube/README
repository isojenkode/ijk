Generate isosurface using Marching Cubes algorithm.

Requires isosurface lookup table (usually stored in ../../isotable).

Can generate isosurfaces in 4D (with appropriate isosurface lookup table.)

Includes options for nep (negative, equals, positive) lookup tables,
high resolution regions, asymptotic decider, and others.
Includes octree option for faster isosurface generation with multiple isovalues.
