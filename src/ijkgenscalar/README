Generate regular scalar grid of any dimension and axis size.

Generates scalar grids whose isosurfaces are cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones,
isosurface lookup table entries, etc.

Also can generate gradient vector fields for many of the scalar fields.

Stores scalar grid and gradient vector fields as Teem nrrd files.
