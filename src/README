Isosurface Jeneration Kode programs:

ijkdual: Generate isosurface using Dual Contouring.
ijkgenscalar: Generate a regular scalar grid (sampling a scalar field).
ijkisoinfo: Return information about an isosurface in a scalar field.
            (Does not compute the isosurface, just some characteristics.)
ijkmcube: Generate isosurface using Marching Cubes.
ijkmesh: Process a mesh (crop, edit, translate, etc.)
ijkmeshdiff: Return differences between two meshes.
ijkmeshinfo: Return information about a mesh (number of vertices/edges/triangles,
             Maximum/minimum angles, manifold properties, self-intersection, etc.)
ijkscalar: Process a regular scalar grid (subsample, supersample, negate, etc.)
           or combine two scalar grids (pointwise max/min of two scalar grids.)
ijkscalarinfo: Return information about a scalar grid (axis sizes,
               number of grid vertices/edges/cubes, min/max scalar values, etc.)
               Also can be used to create histograms of scalar values,
               isosurface area, total and mean gradients, etc.

Other:

NrrdIO: Copy of teem (sourceforge) code for reading/writing nrrd files.
        Used to create NrrdIO library, required by many ijk programs.
ijkMCtable: Code for reading/writing ijk Marching Cubes lookup tables.
        (Also, programs for viewing such tables.)
ijkdualtable: Code for reading/writing ijk dual contouring lookup tables.
        (Also, programs for viewing such tables.)
